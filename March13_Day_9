Today I learned how to use int, and float statements to create a generation identifier.
print("---Generation Identifier---")
print()
year = int(input("Which year were you born? "))
if year >= 1925 and year <= 1946:
  print("You are a Traditionalist!")
elif year >= 1947 and year <= 1964:
  print("You are a Baby Boomer!")
elif year >= 1965 and year <= 1981:
  print("You are a Generation X!")
elif year >= 1982 and year <= 1995:
  print("You are a Millenial!")
elif year >= 1996 and year <= 2015:
  print("You are a Generation Z!")
elif year >= 2016 and year <= 2023:
  print("You are a Generation Alpha!")
else:
  print("You are either too old or too young to be here!")
